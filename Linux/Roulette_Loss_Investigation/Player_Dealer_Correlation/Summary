The player I believe colluding to scam Lucky Duck is Mylie Schmidt and the dealer I believe to scam Lucky Duck is Billy Jones. When Mylie was playing, Billy was the dealer of that day. If you check the time of the huge losses on 10 March, 12 March, and 15 March, Mylies name appeared all the time; if you check the dealers schedule, you can see when Mylie played, Billy was the dealer on those dates and it also corresponds the time when Mylie played and Billy was the dealer.
